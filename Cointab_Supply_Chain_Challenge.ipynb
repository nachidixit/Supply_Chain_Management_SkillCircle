    "##  Business Scenario\n",
    "You are a data analyst working for a large ecommerce company in India (referred to as **Company X**). The company receives a few thousand orders daily and aims to deliver them quickly. To manage deliveries, theyâ€™ve partnered with multiple courier companies that charge per shipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delivery charges depend on:\n",
    "- **Weight of the product**\n",
    "- **Distance** between the warehouse (pickup location) and the customerâ€™s delivery address (destination)\n",
    "\n",
    ">  On average, the delivery charge is **â‚¹100** per shipment. With ~1,00,000 shipments monthly, the cost becomes â‚¹1 crore.\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize costs, **Company X wants to verify** whether the courier companyâ€™s charges per order are accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Input Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ LHS â€“ Company Xâ€™s Internal Data\n",
    "1. **Website Order Report**: Contains `Order ID` and products (SKUs) in each order. (Order ID is the key.)\n",
    "2. **SKU Master**: Includes gross weight of each SKU.\n",
    "3. **Warehouse Pincode to Customer Pincode Mapping**: Helps identify the **Delivery Zone (A/B/C/D/E)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weight Slab Examples:\n",
    "- 400 grams â†’ 0.5 KG\n",
    "- 950 grams â†’ 1.0 KG\n",
    "- 1.0 KG â†’ 1.0 KG\n",
    "- 2.2 KG â†’ 2.5 KG\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ RHS â€“ Courier Company Invoice\n",
    "- `AWB Number` (Courier ID)\n",
    "- `Order ID`\n",
    "- `Charged Weight`\n",
    "- `Warehouse Pincode`\n",
    "- `Customer Pincode`\n",
    "- `Zone of Delivery`\n",
    "- `Shipment Type`\n",
    "- `Charges Billed`\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Rate Card\n",
    "Courier rate card based on:\n",
    "- **Zone-wise charges**\n",
    "- **Weight slabs (0.5 KG intervals)**\n",
    "- Types: `Forward charges` and `RTO charges`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Charging Rule:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Total Charges = Fixed Charge (for first 0.5 KG)\n",
    "              + Additional Charges (for each extra 0.5 KG)\n",
    "```\n",
